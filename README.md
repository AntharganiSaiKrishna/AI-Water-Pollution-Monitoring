üåç AI-Powered Water Pollution Monitoring
AICTE Green AI Internship ‚Äì Environmental Monitoring \& Pollution Control

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing water pollution data using AI \& data science techniques.

The goal is to understand key water quality parameters (like pH, dissolved oxygen, hardness, chloramines, etc.) and prepare the data for building AI models that can assist in predicting pollution levels and supporting smarter environmental monitoring.


Dataset:

Source: Kaggle ‚Äì Water Quality Dataset
File Used: Water\_Quality\_Dataset.csv
The dataset contains values of water quality indicators and labels whether the water is potable (safe to drink) or not.

Steps Completed (Week 1):

Imported required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Loaded dataset into Jupyter Notebook.

Explored dataset using:

.info() ‚Äì structure \& datatypes
.describe() ‚Äì statistical summary
.isnull().sum() ‚Äì missing values check


Example Insights:


Detect missing values in water quality measurements.
Understand ranges of features like pH, hardness, chloramines, and solids.
Prepare data for AI/ML model training in upcoming weeks.


Tech Stack:

Language: Python 
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Platform: GitHub


Future Work:

Handle missing values.
Feature engineering for pollution classification.
Train AI models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
Build a real-time dashboard for pollution monitoring.
